### Retry Policies

> Sample notification subscription object with custom retry policy.

```json
{
  "url" : "$REQUEST_BIN?path=${PATH}&system=${SYSTEM}&event=${EVENT}",
  "event" : "*",
  "persistent": true,
  "policy": {
      "retryStrategy": "IMMEDIATE",
      "retryLimit": 20,
      "retryRate": 5,
      "retryDelay": 0,
      "saveOnFailure": true
    }
}
```

In some situations, Agave may be unable to publish a specific notification. When this happens, Agave will immediately retry the notification 5 times in an attempt to deliver it successfully. When delivery fails for a 5th time, the notification is abandoned. If your application requires a more tenacious or methodical approach to retry delivery, you may provide a notification policy.

<%= partial "includes/tables/83-notification-policy" %>

Notification retry policies describe the strategy, frequency, delay, limit, and persistence to be applied when publishing an individual event for a given notification. The example above is our previous example with a notification policy included.


### Failed deliveries

> Query failed attempts for a specific notification

```shell
curl -sk -H "Authorization: Bearer $ACCESS_TOKEN" \
     https://$API_BASE_URL/notifications/$API_VERSION/229681451607921126-8e1831906a8e-0001-042"/attempts
```

```plaintext

```

> A list of notification attempts will be returned.

```javascript

    "response" : {
      "code" : 500,
      "message" : ""
    },
    "_links" : {
      "self" : {
        "href" : "https://$API_BASE_URL/notifications/$API_VERSION/229123105859441126-8e1831906a8e-0001-011/attempts/229681451607921126-8e1831906a8e-0001-042"
      },
      "notification" : {
        "href" : "https://$API_BASE_URL/notifications/$API_VERSION/5833036796741676570-b0b0b0bb0b-0001-011"
      },
      "profile" : {
        "href" : "https://$API_BASE_URL/profiles/$API_VERSION/ipcservices"
      }
    }
  }
]
```

By providing a retry policy where `saveOnFailure` is true, failed messages will be persisted and made available for querying at a later time. This is a great way to handled missed work due to a server failure, maintenance downtime, etc. To query for for failed messages

<div class="warning">Note: There is no way to save successful notification deliveries.</div>
