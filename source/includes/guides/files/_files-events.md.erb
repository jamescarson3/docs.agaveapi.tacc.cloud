### File events

Agave throws file events on every content change, permission change, and file item access request in the platform. A list of the file events thrown is given in the following table.

<%= partial "includes/tables/46" %>

File events do not happen in a vaccuum. A file item only exists within the context of a System, so enable aggregate listeners across an entire system, a corresponding system event is thrown for each file event. System event names are constructed by prefixing the file event name with `SYSTEM_`.
