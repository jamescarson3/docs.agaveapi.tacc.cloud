### File metadata management

In many systems, the concept of metadata is directly tied to the notion of a file system. Agave takes a broader view of metadata and supports it as its own first class resource in the REST API. For more information on how to leverage metadata in Agave, please consult the <a href="#metadata" title="Metadata Tutorial">Metadata Guide</a>. In there we cover all aspects of how to manage, search, validate, and associate metadata across your entire digital lab.
